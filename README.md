# Casper Universities Roadshow

Welcome to the repository for the Casper Universities Roadshow. This space is dedicated to organizing resources, content, and plans related to the initiative.

## Overview

The Casper Universities Roadshow is a flagship initiative designed to impart knowledge about the Casper Network to aspiring developers at the university level. Our vision is to enable and equip developers with the necessary knowledge of the Casper Network in a structured manner.

### Objective

The objective of the roadshow is to create a comprehensive plan for introducing the Casper Blockchain to universities, involving several key components:

- **Purpose of the Roadshow:**
  - Increase awareness of Casper.
  - Expand Casper's reach in the academic and developer communities.
  - Foster developer adoption and encourage the development of meaningful projects on the Casper platform.

- **Support System Requirements:**
  - Utilize official Casper documentation, videos, and tutorials.
  - Ensure availability of physical/virtual support from Developer Advocates.

### Plan Outline

#### Session 1: Introduction to Blockchain and Casper

- General introduction to blockchain technology.
- Detailed introduction to the Casper Blockchain, highlighting its unique features and benefits for developers.
- Overview of Casper for developers, covering concepts, design, accounts and keys, hash types, and the deployment lifecycle.
- Hands-on session on interacting with a Casper Blockchain node using the Casper client.
- Development prerequisites including the Casper JSON-RPC API and querying a Casper Network.

#### Session 2: Smart Contract Development

- Introduction to writing simple smart contracts.
- Getting started with Rust for smart contract development.
- Unit testing, upgrading, and maintaining smart contracts.
- Best practices for Casper smart contract authors.
- Practical hands-on session on writing, deploying, and interacting with a smart contract on the Casper Testnet.

#### Session 3: DApp Development

- Deep dive into creating a decentralized application (DApp).
- Introduction to dApps, prerequisites, and using a front-end template with React.
- Focus on how to interact with the Casper Blockchain in a DApp.
- Practical session on DApp development.

### Resources

- Official Casper Blockchain documentation and developer guides.
- Interactive tutorials and video content related to Casper Blockchain development.
- Sample codes and templates for smart contracts and DApps.
- Access to Casper Testnet for practical sessions.
- Contact details for Developer Advocates for ongoing support and queries.

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

- Number of attendees per session.
- Level of engagement in hands-on sessions (e.g., number of smart contracts written and deployed).
- Post-event survey results measuring increased understanding and interest in Casper.
- Number of follow-up projects or inquiries related to Casper development.
- Growth in the Casper developer community following the roadshow.

This structured approach ensures that each session builds on the previous one, leading to a comprehensive understanding of Casper Blockchain and its potential applications. The support system and resources provided will aid in the effective delivery of content, while the KPIs will help in measuring the success and impact of the roadshow.
